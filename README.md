# surfs_up

## Overview

The purpose of this project was to perform an in-depth analysis on temperature data, specifically for the months of June and December. This analysis will help understand if the 'surf n' shake' shop could be sustainable year-round. The surf and ice cream shop is an investment plan to try to live and work in Hawaii. W. Avy, an investor, laid out an analysis plan to support the pitch to potential futher investors by analyzing trends on weather and precipitation data displayed through a Flask application.

Table 2. December temperature summary statistics

- The mean temperature trend for June is ~75°F, and the mean temperature for December is 71°F.

- The standard deviation of the temperature for June is ~3.3°F, and ~3.8°F for December.

- The minimum temperature for June is 64°F and a maximum of 85°F. The minimum temperature for December is 56°F and a maxmimum of 84°F.


## Summary

The results show that the surf and ice cream shop should be sustainable year round. The difference between the mean temperatures was 4°F, making it a small difference and hardly noticeable when outside. The difference between the standard deviations were very small, meaning that temperature variations are very similar in both months. The maximum temperatures had a difference of 1°F, indicating that temperature peaks have a low marginal difference. Although, the minimum temperature for December is 8°F colder, at 56°F, indicates there could be less business. An additional query to perform would be calculating the frequency of lower temperatures for December to see if there are many cold days or if the minimum was an outlier. Another query to perform would be gathering precipitation summary statistics for December and June to understand rainfall trends further.
