## Overview

The purpose of this project was to perform an in-depth analysis on temperature data, specifically for the months of June and December. This analysis will help understand if the 'surf n' shake' shop could be sustainable year-round. The surf and ice cream shop is an investment plan to try to live and work in Hawaii. W. Avy, an investor, laid out an analysis plan to support the pitch to potential futher investors by analyzing trends on weather and precipitation data displayed through a Flask application.

## Results

- The mean temperature trend for June is ~75°F, and the mean temperature for December is 71°F.

- The standard deviation of the temperature for June is ~3.3°F, and ~3.8°F for December.

- The minimum temperature for June is 64°F and a maximum of 85°F. The minimum temperature for December is 56°F and a maxmimum of 84°F.
